## Overview

It is a full-stack project built with ReactJS, SASS, and Firebase. The website has a shopping cart and checkout system, an admin dashboard, and a user authentication system.

## Features

- Admin dashboard to manage products, orders, and coupon codes.
- Users can create an account and login to the website.
- Users can view their orders and order history.
- Users can apply coupon codes to their orders.

## Details

The main challenge of this project was to build a shopping cart and checkout system that is easy to use and works well on both desktop and mobile devices, all without using any third-party providers like Shopify or WooCommerce.

The website uses Firebase's Firestore database to store products, users' data, orders, and coupon codes. The website also uses Firebase's Authentication service to handle user authentication.

The website has a shopping cart system that allows users to add products to their cart, update the quantity of each product, and remove products from their cart. The shopping cart system also calculates the total price of the order and applies any coupon codes that the user has entered.

The website also has an admin dashboard that allows the business owner to add & edit products, view orders, and update order status.

The admin is notified via email when a new order is placed. The admin can also update the order status from the admin dashboard.
