## Overview

Certi is a platform that allows users to create and issue NFT certificates.

It offers a straightforward solution via a simple editor that requires no technical expertise.

It also allows users to customize templates to their liking.

## Features

- Create and issue NFT certificates
- Customize templates
- Simple editor that requires no technical expertise

## Details

The main challenge was to generate the certificates using the Canvas API for customization and flexibility.

The solution was to use the `toBlob()` method to convert the canvas to an image and then upload it to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).

After that, the image is minted as an NFT and the certificate is issued to the user.

Later, the user can view the certificate on their [wallet](https://app.mynearwallet.com/nft-detail/mintapp.certi.near/bafybeifhm5ib6htqcflcof6rxbf3kxe4urpcg3gaaqybes4u565s7drlw4) (check last screenshot).

All of the communication with the smart contract is done using the [NEAR JS API](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference).
